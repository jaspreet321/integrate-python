#read whole script thoroughly
#Intentations/spacing is very imp in WHILE command, see below where the PRINT command & 'i' is mentioned.



i = 1                        #initializing value of "i" as 1

while i<=50:                 #this line will check if "i" is less than or equal to 50
    print("testing")         #if above line is turns out to be true, then this print line keep on printing testing without stopping 
    i = i + 1                #this line will start counting i from number 1 & goes till 50, once i becomes 51 then 'testing' will stop pri                             nting, because as stated above while loop will only run until i is less than or eaquals to 50.
